The No Surprises Act, passed in 2021, banned the practice of billing patients for the difference between what their insurer pays and what a provider charges when patients unknowingly receive care from an out-of-network provider. The law also established a federal IDR process that out-of-network providers and insurers can use to determine the OON rate that providers should receive if the two parties fail in their own attempts to negotiate. 

This project analyzed IDR disputes initiated through the federal IDR process in 2024, and identified the top groups initiating disputes, the "winners" and how the outcomes might impact providers, payers and patients. The data story is published at: https://jinghongchen.com/2025/07/14/providers-are-winning-more-surprise-billing-disputes-than-ever/

Data is based on CMS's Federal IDR PUF for 2024 Q1-Q4. (https://www.cms.gov/nosurprises/policies-and-resources/reports)
